# Structural Hygiene

Aphelion uses file size as a review signal, not as an automatic refactor order.
Large files are acceptable only when they have a clear durable responsibility and
an explicit split direction. New large files should be rare.

## Rules

- Go files over 800 lines, including tests, must appear in this ledger.
- A large file should have one owner concept, not a grab bag of unrelated flows.
- Split when a file mixes durable concepts, grows a second ownership boundary, or
  blocks local reasoning. Do not split only to satisfy a line counter.
- Top-level packages and stable subpackages that own authority, credentials,
  durable state, transports, tools, or external effects must carry a `doc.go`
  ownership note that names what the package owns and what it must not import or
  decide. Tiny adapters, generated fixtures, and temporary internal leaves are
  exempt until they become a stable ownership boundary.
- Delete completed plans and transient migration notes after their durable
  content is moved into current docs.

## Ledger

| File | Owner concept | Split direction |
|---|---|---|
| `agent/turn_test.go` | Agent turn-loop tests covering provider replies, tool-call sequencing, parallel tool batches, observer events, retry behavior, and cancellation. | Split observer/parallelism scenarios from provider-error and planning-only retry scenarios when those fixture shapes stop sharing the same turn harness. |
| `config/config.go` | Config schema type declarations for the single-binary TOML contract, including identity, provider, transport, storage, integration, and runtime control records. | Split type groups by durable config domain only when edits require independent ownership; provider/integration families are the first candidates, while defaults and load normalization stay with the config package contract. |
| `config/load_defaults_test.go` | Config loading defaults, live example coverage, ignored-key behavior, and config parser compatibility tests. | Split broad default snapshots into domain-focused config test files when one config domain starts carrying most of the fixture surface. |
| `config/validate.go` | Config schema validation and operator-safe config error shaping. | Split durable sub-schema validators into focused files when validation logic starts crossing config-domain boundaries. |
| `internal/telegramcommands/commands_session_status_test.go` | Telegram command tests for operator session/status surfaces and adjacent command-card controls that share the same command router and sender fixtures. | Split lifecycle commands, status cards, and context/memory/agents callback scenarios when their fixture setup diverges or one surface grows beyond shared command-smoke coverage. |
| `runtime/continuation_operation_plan.go` | Runtime projection from operation phase plans to continuation approval boundaries: plan-lease construction, stale phase cleanup, phase bundle selection, and phase-to-continuation matching. | Split phase-plan lease construction from phase approval/budget classification when approval families, gate policy, or matching helpers grow independent tests or ownership. |
| `runtime/constitution_test.go` | Runtime delivery constitution, brokerage adaptation, media repair, and execution-evidence grounding tests. | Split brokerage convergence, media repair, and execution-grounding fixtures when one area needs independent setup or begins obscuring the delivery contract under test. |
| `runtime/tool_progress_reporter.go` | Turn monitor and Telegram tool-progress rendering, delivery, controls, caching, and progress-event evidence. | Split event-monitor recording from Telegram progress rendering when either side grows a separate lifecycle or transport boundary. |
| `session/store_schema.go` | SQLite schema versioning, migrations, and idempotent table/index repair for durable session storage. | Split migration families by durable session concept when schema repair helpers start requiring different ownership boundaries. |
| `session/store_schema_migration_test.go` | SQLite schema migration compatibility tests for historical session database versions and backfills. | Split migration fixtures by version family or durable record family when compatibility setup stops fitting one chronological migration harness. |
| `tool/native_file_tools.go` | Native file, fetch, and extraction tool implementations under sandbox and authority ceilings. | Split fetch/network policy and document extraction into focused files while keeping native tool registration local. |
