# Config — Configuration & String Anonymization

## Overview

Aphelion's config is a single TOML file that controls the entire runtime. Every identifiable string — project name, user-agent headers, system prompt markers — is either configurable or absent. The goal: no provider can fingerprint the harness from the traffic it sees.

The live schema is the TOML shape accepted by `config.Config` and represented
by `config.example.toml`; that example is load-tested with no ignored-key
warnings. This requirements file also preserves future configuration homes so
the design does not collapse around the initial working path. Keys shown outside
the live schema are future design notes: if an operator puts them in today's
config, startup/check-config, `/status`, and `/health diagnose` must surface ignored-key
warnings rather than imply active behavior.

This spec therefore distinguishes between:

- **Live schema**: keys accepted by `config.Config` and covered by `config.example.toml`.
- **Implemented behavior**: the subset currently honored by the runtime.
- **Future knobs**: design-reserved keys that may appear here before they are wired, but must never silently misrepresent active behavior.

## Config File

Default location: `~/.aphelion/aphelion.toml`

Override via `APHELION_CONFIG` env var or `--config` flag.

Operators should also have an explicit initialization path, e.g. `aphelion init`,
that seeds missing prompt files under `agent.prompt_root` without overwriting
existing files.

Telegram progress configuration is intentionally split into:

- **whether** progress appears at all (`tool_progress`)
- **how** it is rendered (`tool_progress_style`)
- **how much** of it remains visible (`tool_progress_window`)

The default operator experience should favor semantic, readable progress over raw command dumps.

Implementation is no longer documented as a broad hidden schema contract. Live
operator keys belong in `config.Config` and `config.example.toml`; future homes
may be described here only as design notes and must produce ignored-key
warnings if used in today's config.

Autonomy is a config-owned policy, not a prompt convention. `default_mode` and
`ceiling` use `off`, `review_only`, `ask_first`, `leased`, or `mission`; the
configured default must not exceed the ceiling. In the current runtime this
policy is validated and projected through CLI, `/status`, and `/health diagnose`.
`leased` live overrides are implemented as bounded auto mode records and cannot
exceed the configured ceiling or maximum duration. Approval grants remain
separate spendable prompt budget. If config later tightens below
`leased` or disables live overrides, existing mode records become inert and
doctor reports the blocked precedence.

## Durable Telegram Group Bootstrap

Implemented behavior:

- `[[telegram.durable_groups]]` admits specific Telegram groups as durable children.
- Each admitted group must define a child-local node LLM bootstrap.
- The runtime currently supports:
- `llm_backend = "native"` with `llm_provider = "anthropic" | "openai" | "openrouter" | "gemini" | "ollama"`
  - `llm_backend = "codex"` with child-local Codex auth/home settings
- A durable child must not inherit the parent governor/provider credentials.
- If the child bootstrap is missing or invalid, the durable child should fail rather than silently execute on the parent's LLM credentials.

Current implementation detail:

- same-host Telegram durable groups seed their child bootstrap from `aphelion.toml`
- the durable-agent record persists that bootstrap separately from live policy
- parent-authored live policy may narrow behavior within the bootstrap ceiling, but it does not carry secret-bearing LLM credentials

## String Anonymization

### The Problem

Claude's subscription terms restrict third-party tool use. Detection likely keys on identifiable strings: project names in system prompts, distinctive user-agent headers, characteristic message structures, metadata fields.

### The Solution

**Nothing identifies the harness unless you choose to.**

1. **HTTP User-Agent**: Configurable. Default is Go's standard `Go-http-client/2.0` — indistinguishable from any Go program.

2. **No project name in API traffic.** The word "aphelion" (or any project name) never appears in:
   - HTTP headers sent to providers
   - System prompts
   - Tool definitions
   - Message content injected by the runtime

3. **System prompt markers**: No `<!-- CACHE_BOUNDARY -->` or equivalent marker strings. Cache boundaries are managed by message structure and the Anthropic `cache_control` API field, not inline text markers.

4. **Tool names**: Generic. `exec`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `web_fetch`, `memory_search`. Not branded.

5. **Error messages**: "Tool execution failed" not "Aphelion tool execution failed".

6. **No telemetry.** No analytics. No phone-home. No crash reporting.

7. **HTTP headers**: Only the minimum required headers. No `X-Aphelion-*` headers. No custom trace IDs in provider requests.

8. **Anthropic API version**: Standard `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` header. Nothing extra.

### What a Provider Sees

```http
POST /v1/messages HTTP/2
Host: api.anthropic.com
anthropic-version: 2023-06-01
x-api-key: sk-ant-...
content-type: application/json
user-agent: Go-http-client/2.0

{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "max_tokens": 16384,
  "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral", "ttl": "1h"},
  "system": [...],
  "messages": [...]
}
```

Indistinguishable from any Go application using the Anthropic API directly.

## Credential Management

### At Rest

Credentials can be stored in:
1. **Config file** (`config.toml`) — simple, appropriate for single-user machines
2. **Environment variables** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, etc.
3. **Env file** — `.env` in the config directory, loaded at startup

Priority: env vars > env file > config file.

### In Memory (memfd)

At startup, credentials are:
1. Read from their source
2. Written to a `memfd_create(2)` anonymous memory fd with `MFD_CLOEXEC`
3. Original env vars are overwritten with zeros via `os.Unsetenv()` + explicit zeroing
4. The memfd is `MFD_CLOEXEC` — invisible to child processes spawned via `exec`

```go
func sealCredential(key string, value []byte) (*MemCredential, error) {
    fd, err := unix.MemfdCreate("cred-"+key, unix.MFD_CLOEXEC)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    f := os.NewFile(uintptr(fd), key)
    f.Write(value)
    // Optionally: unix.Fmemfd_seal(fd, F_SEAL_WRITE|F_SEAL_SHRINK|F_SEAL_GROW)
    // to make the fd immutable after writing
    f.Seek(0, 0)
    for i := range value {
        value[i] = 0
    }
    return &MemCredential{file: f}, nil
}
```

The optional `F_SEAL_*` flags make the memfd immutable after initial write — prevents any code path from accidentally modifying credentials in-memory.

### Credential Injection

Provider adapters read credentials from the sealed memfd per-request:

```go
func (c *MemCredential) Read() ([]byte, error) {
    c.mu.RLock()
    defer c.mu.RUnlock()
    c.file.Seek(0, 0)
    return io.ReadAll(c.file)
}
```

Thread-safe via `RWMutex`. Multiple goroutines (concurrent turns for different sessions) can read credentials simultaneously.

## Config Loading

```go
func Load(path string) (*Config, error) {
    // 1. Read TOML file via BurntSushi/toml
    // 2. Apply env var overrides (APHELION_* prefix, nested via __)
    //    e.g. APHELION_PROVIDERS__ANTHROPIC__API_KEY
    // 3. Load .env file if present (simple KEY=VALUE parsing, no shell expansion)
    // 4. Expand ~ in paths to $HOME
    // 5. Validate:
    //    - Required: telegram.bot_token, at least one provider with api_key
    //    - providers.selection must be auto|manual, and the effective provider chain must reference configured providers
    //    - cache_ttl must be "5m" or "1h"
    //    - max_context_tokens < provider's context_window
    //    - logging.level must be debug|info|warn|error
    //    - active_hours.start < active_hours.end
    // 6. Seal credentials into memfd
    // 7. Return Config
}
```

### Recovery watchdog

```toml
[recovery.watchdog]
enabled = true
stale_turn_threshold = "3m"
stale_turn_limit = 8
```

The stale-turn watchdog is a scoped recovery controller, not a generic process
supervisor. It records stale-turn evidence, cancels matching in-process turns
when possible, interrupts the exact stale `turn_runs` and matching Telegram
ingress rows, then records recovery or retry state. It does not broaden into a
process restart policy.

### Hot Reload

Not supported in v1. Restart is cheap (<100ms cold start).

## Staging

- **Required for a runnable daemon**: identity strings, active channel credentials, one working provider, session storage, config-assigned Telegram principals, workspace prompt files, and the agent execution limits that bound a turn.
- **Required for the governor/face architecture**: a governor backend selection policy, Codex-friendly governor ownership boundaries, and an explicit face rendering slot even if the first implementation is thin.
- **Required for DM admission and authority**: a config-owned principal model for Telegram DMs, at least one admin principal, and clear config ownership for later authority roles and isolated roots.
- **Required for a hardened local system tool**: sandbox controls, HTTP transport tuning, failover policy, and credential sealing.
- **Reserved architectural surface**: any future group, durable-agent, provider, embedding, voice, cron, or deeper Linux controls may be described here only as future design notes until they are accepted by `config.Config` and `config.example.toml`.

## Decisions

- **TOML.** Human-friendly, comment-friendly, Go ecosystem default.
- **Single file.** No `config.d/`, no merge logic. One file, one truth.
- **Live schema before breadth.** Config breadth is not a promise. Live keys must be accepted, validated, projected, and tested; future keys must warn if used.
- **Admission and authority are first-class config concerns.** Config is the source of truth for Telegram admin principals and the roots/policies used by scoped child principals.
- **Governor and face are separate config concerns.** Decision-making and presentation should be independently configurable even if one implementation path is initially minimal.
- **memfd with F_SEAL for credentials.** Immutable in-memory secrets. Defense in depth.
- **No hot reload.** Simplicity. Single-binary restart is fast.
- **Bootstrap vs dynamic files.** Bootstrap files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, etc.) are stable and go in the cached prefix. Dynamic files (MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, daily notes) change often and go after the cache boundary. This maximizes cache hit rate.
- **Provider context windows are explicit.** No guessing. The config states the model's actual context window, and the session manager uses it for compaction decisions.
- **HTTP transport is configurable.** TCP keepalive, TLS version, timeouts — all exposed. For a daemon that maintains long-lived connections to 2-3 providers, these matter.

## Tests

### config loading

- **TestLoadMinimal**: TOML with only `[telegram]` bot_token and `[providers.anthropic]` api_key → loads without error, defaults are correct (workspace path, max_iterations=50, etc.).
- **TestLoadFull**: TOML with every field populated → all fields parsed correctly.
- **TestMissingRequired**: TOML without telegram.bot_token → returns descriptive error.
- **TestExpandTilde**: Paths like `~/workspace` expand to absolute paths.
- **TestEnvOverride**: Set `APHELION_PROVIDERS__ANTHROPIC__API_KEY=sk-test` → overrides config file value.
- **TestEnvFile**: Write `.env` file with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-env` → loaded when config file value is empty.
- **TestPrecedence**: Config file has key A, env file has key B, env var has key C → env var wins.

### credential sealing (memfd)

- **TestSealCredential**: Seal a string → read it back → matches original.
- **TestSealZerosOriginal**: Seal a byte slice → original slice is all zeros after sealing.
- **TestSealedNotInEnviron**: Seal from env var → `os.Getenv()` returns empty after sealing.
- **TestMemfdCloexec**: Sealed fd has CLOEXEC flag set (via `fcntl` check).
- **TestMemfdSeal**: After sealing with F_SEAL_WRITE, writing to fd returns error.
- **TestConcurrentRead**: 100 goroutines read credential simultaneously → all get correct value, no races.

### anonymization

- **TestDefaultUserAgent**: Default config → User-Agent header is Go's default, not "aphelion".
- **TestNoProjectNameInHeaders**: Build an HTTP request with default config → no header contains "aphelion".
- **TestCustomUserAgent**: Set `identity.user_agent = "MyBot/1.0"` → User-Agent header matches.
- **TestSystemPromptNoMarkers**: Assemble a system prompt from bootstrap files → no cache boundary markers, no project name strings.

### sandbox & security

- **TestCgroupCreation**: With sandbox enabled, exec creates cgroup under configured root with correct memory/cpu/pid limits.
- **TestNetworkFirewall**: With `isolation = "firewall"`, exec can reach `api.anthropic.com:443` but not `evil.com:443`.
- **TestNetworkFull**: With `isolation = "full"`, exec cannot reach any network address.
- **TestNetworkNone**: With `isolation = "none"`, exec has full network access.
- **TestHiddenPaths**: With `hidden_paths` set, exec cannot read `~/.aphelion/aphelion.toml`.
- **TestSeccompModerate**: With `seccomp = "moderate"`, exec cannot call `ptrace()` or `mount()`.
- **TestUserNamespace**: With `user_namespace = true`, exec runs as uid 65534 (nobody).
- **TestDropCapabilities**: Exec process does not have CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_NET_ADMIN.
- **TestResourceLimits**: Exec process that exceeds memory_limit is OOM-killed by cgroup.

### validation

- **TestInvalidProvider**: `providers.default = "nonexistent"` → error.
- **TestInvalidCacheTTL**: `providers.anthropic.cache_ttl = "10m"` → error (only "5m" or "1h" allowed).
- **TestInvalidLogLevel**: `logging.level = "verbose"` → error.
- **TestContextExceedsWindow**: `sessions.max_context_tokens = 250000` with `providers.anthropic.context_window = 200000` → error.
- **TestActiveHoursInvalid**: `start = "22:00", end = "08:00"` → error (or handle wrap-around — decide in implementation).
